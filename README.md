# breeze-calculations-vuejs

### Simple prototype calculations project based on (vue js, tailwind css) frameworks

I suggest you two ways open the project in your favourite browser

1) Open index.html in your favourite browser

2) Start builtin php server in terminal
```
php -S localhost:8087
```
then open http://localhost:8087 in a browser
